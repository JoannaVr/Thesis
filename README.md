In this thesis an application is implemented, which classifies three types of emotions from EEG waves using deep learning methods. The methodologies used were of MLP, Keras API, LSTM, GRU and CNN making direct comparison in order to show the optimal one. The data processed were brain waves taken from an experiment in which participants watched videos while their emotional state was recorded by an electroencephalogram. The resulting emotions were categorized into positive, negative and neutral. The theoretical background of this implementation highlights three chapters, which develop: emotion perception, the neuroscience of cognition and data with deep learning. In these, the concepts of cognition, emotion, cognitive reflection, neuroscience, electroencephalography, data types, quality and preprocessing are expanded, as well as a few words about machine and deep learning. The remaining chapters include the introduction, the application including the implementation as well as the final conclusions. The choice of this topic was inspired by the functioning of the human brain. The ability to read the human mind through deep learning can also be considered an art, as it opens new horizons for the interpretation of brain function, which has not been fully understood to this day. This paper was a challenge to deep learning methods, as well as a discovery of where technology has come and how far it has yet to evolve.
